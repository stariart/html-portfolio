<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sara and I live and breathe in the city of Southampton, on the south coast of the UK.
  I love anything to do with art and design.
  Symmetry is a passion of mine, and I love anything to do with mandala's and sacred geometry.
</p>

<p>I have been making no-code websites for a few years now, all self taught on various platforms, but I am currently studying coding, and LOVING the learning process so far!</p>

<p>I can't wait to show the world what I can do! and at the matured age of 45 years old, I still LOVE to learn!
  My family and loved ones call me a human sponge!
